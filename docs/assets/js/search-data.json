    "content": "This tutorial is a resource that accompanies a robust set of resources including a publication, psuedo-code, github repository, and data repository for constructing a three-dimensional grid of geologically realistic representations of seafloor crustal relief. The three-dimensional simulation domain described here has been used in multiple publications focusing on the thermal and hydrogeologic regime of coupled fluxes beneath a marine sediment pond (Price et al., 2022; Price et al., in-prep). The tutorial can be broken down into a workflow consisting of 5 main sections: constructing surfaces, constructing a domain, refining the domain, defining and assigning material types to regions, and a general clean-up of the domain. There will be two examples included for each step. One example will use a general case that will introduce the concepts in a simple manner and the other example will be for construction of the North Pond domain. This tutorial will not be an exhaustive tutorial on the functionality of LaGriT as there are many examples that can be found here. Instead, this tutorial will serve as a \"cookbook\" that allows the user to understand the steps used in construction of this simulation domain using the lessons and approaches explained below. Happy gridding! . ",

    "content": "To complete this tutorial you will need a stable version of LaGriT (version) and optionally Paraview. LaGriT . LaGriT is available at https://github.com/lanl/LaGriT/releases and can be downloaded as a compiled version (preferred) or the source code for compiling. After downloading LaGriT, add the file to a location within your path, and modify the file permissions to executable. Paraview (optional) . Paraview is a powerful visualization platform used for the primary grid viewer in this tutorial. Graphics here will be provided inline so there is no need to download for the purpose of this tutorial but it is recommended to explore the full functionality of this workflow. Paraview can be downloaded athttps://www.paraview.org/download/ . Data files . This tutorial utilizes scripts and data files from a github repository that can be found at https://github.com/adamnicholasprice/GeologicGriddingData. This repository can be cloned via the command line or downloaded directly from the github website. There are four directories: . • GeneralLaGriT - LaGriT scripts and csv surfaces for building the general grid case . • GeneralScene - Paraview scene files for general grid case used in this tutorial . • NorthPondLaGriT - LaGriT scripts and csv surfaces for building the North Pond grid case . • NorthPondScene - Paraview scene files for North Pond grid case used in this tutorial .
